# Architecture

## System shape

LOO/UME is a generative sculpture compiler and browser editor for pose-first,
panel-based LED sculptures.
Schema 2 sculpture JSON and the selected panel profile are the authorities.

```text
Schema 2 JSON + panel profile
             |
       panel poses
       /    |    \
    view  mapping  wiring
       \    |    /
      assembly package
        /         \
 planar closure  structural connectors
        \         /
       exact Manifold assets
```

Fabrication is optional. A project without `mechanicalShell`, `closures`, or
generated assets can load, edit, simulate, map, wire, save, and reopen. A panel
edit marks derived mechanics stale but does not stop those functions.

## Authoritative data flow

1. `parsePanelAssemblyDefinition()` is the central deep Schema 2 runtime
   validator. `LoadPanelAssemblyProject.ts` is the thin CLI file adapter, while
   browser and portable-project adapters use the same profile-resolving loader.
2. `panelEmitterLocalPositions()` normalizes an optional row-major pose-local
   grid-coordinate emitter list or derives the legacy rectangular grid.
   `createPanelAssemblyMapping()` expands those positions through authoritative
   poses into LED world positions, logical indices, and mapping metadata. The
   logical order uses one-billionth normalized UV bins, then panel address.
   This key prevents platform float noise from ordering symmetric emitters.
   The separate optional carrier contract affects display geometry and tool
   capability only; it does not become a second address authority.
   Optional planar carrier apertures are display cutouts only and do not become
   mounting or fabrication authority.
   A non-legacy carrier can use required pose-local DIN/DOUT anchors instead of
   claiming the historical three-hole orientation. Provisional photo-study
   evidence remains labelled provisional through load and portable export.
3. `optimizeAutomaticWiring()` can write a deterministic balanced route, GPIO
   set, and physical local-Z panel orientation. `createProvisionalWiringPreview()`
   uses that saved route or creates a labelled legacy draft suggestion. The
   controller keeps an optional right-handed world pose. Its local output-pin
   offsets rotate with that pose, so preview cables and route-cost geometry use
   the same controller frame. Editing that pose invalidates old route-optimized
   installed-address evidence without invalidating printable panel mechanics.
4. `createHardwareMappingContract()` compiles physical indices and the WLED
   ledmap from the same current project.
5. `createMadMapperFixtureBundle()` derives the supported SVG fixture atlas and
   patch manifest from a mapping-ready hardware contract.
   Each rectangular fixture samples its LED UV center within the fixed 2:1 frame.
   Samples span at most one image pixel. Empty areas remain unsampled.
   Do not stretch fixtures to fill empty areas: this changes their sampling positions.
   `createMadMapperPackageZip()` adds the readable CSV and draft settings PDF;
   final network values remain evidence-gated.
   `createTouchDesignerPackageFiles()` adds a reusable TOP component and bounded
   DDP sender. The component makes a centered 2:1 image internally. It targets
   the simulator in logical LED order. It does not require a WLED identity.
6. `createHerma4385PanelLabelsPdf()` places current Schema 2 panel IDs on the
   measured 15 x 21 A4 stock grid. Printer registration remains
   outside the document geometry. The simulator anchors the same
   ID at the wiring preview's DIN position; neither path creates saved state.
7. `preflightPanelBoundaryParts()` is the shared browser/CLI fit gate. It
   derives or reuses corner-only gap cycles and validates the closed boundary,
   PCB envelopes, and compiled closure topology before Manifold or publication.
   `compilePanelBoundaryBundle()` then compiles the exact STL bytes.
8. `runStructuralPipeline()` derives eligible anchors from the same poses and
   profile, runs advisory load-path analysis, and compiles either modular
   connector ribbons or LED-surface bridges into exact STL/3MF assets.
9. `ProjectPackage.ts` wraps the portable project files in the same versioned
   `.loo.zip` format used by demo, local-library, backup, and transfer projects.
   It embeds a manifest and thumbnail. New browser saves use one 480 x 300
   WebGL render with the current viewport direction and mapping-fit camera;
   older pose-derived SVG thumbnails remain loadable.
   `createCompleteProjectPackageZip()` adds all current fabrication, mapping,
   WLED, MadMapper, and TouchDesigner files to this editable project package.
   Its package manifest records each unavailable optional output.

There is no project database or browser-local project authority. Persistence
uses a folder of validated project ZIPs. Repository demo ZIPs are deterministic
artifacts generated from the unpacked authored Schema 2 sources; local ZIPs are
ignored by Git. Every package uses safe relative asset references and SHA-256
values.
Before extraction, ZIP import reads the bounded central directory and rejects
excessive archive bytes, entry count, per-entry expansion, total expansion,
suspicious compression ratios, ZIP64, multi-disk, encrypted, or inconsistent
entries. Streaming extraction checks local entries against that preflight
before it buffers their bytes.

The desktop server and Vite development adapter share one project library
handler. It is loopback-only by default; the explicit `npm run lan` review mode
permits non-loopback Host values and exposes project ZIPs on that trusted network.
It enumerates regular `.loo.zip` files under tracked `demo/`
and ignored `local/` directories, validates each bounded package, caches it by
file identity, and returns exact ZIP or embedded-thumbnail bytes. Invalid
packages are diagnostic entries and are never openable. Static hosting falls
back to the tracked demo manifest and stays read-only. The desktop library sorts
validated entries by modification time, newest first. Local saves validate the
complete package before an atomic temporary-file replacement. A rename, delete,
or overwrite of a bundled demo creates an ignored local copy or a persistent
local hide record; it never changes the Git-managed demo ZIP. Create, replace,
rename, and delete requests use package SHA-256 revisions as HTTP preconditions,
so a browser cannot silently replace a ZIP changed after it was opened. The
main Save action requires operator confirmation before it overwrites the
selected library entry.

`bootstrap.sh` selects a reviewed native stage-zero executable. The strict
install manifest pins official Node.js archives by target, byte size, SHA-256,
and extracted-tree identity. It installs Node/npm and dependencies only below
the repository, then proves the production desktop and Manifold path.
`bootstrap.sh launch` reuses that proof only when the target tuple, clean
commit, required runtime packages, and complete hashed `dist/` tree match its
private receipt. It starts the loopback server and opens the ready URL when the
host has a graphical browser opener. `bootstrap.sh update` accepts only
fast-forward-only `main` updates from the canonical HTTPS `origin`. It
temporarily stashes tracked and untracked local changes, applies the verified
fast-forward, restores those changes, and then executes the updated launcher.
Ignored local project-library ZIPs never move. A restore conflict stops before
launch and retains the recovery stash. The production UI uses the same boundary
to report and apply available updates.

The deprecated lightweight Mac launcher is a compatibility wrapper, not a
second editor runtime. On first launch it uses the macOS authorization boundary to
copy its application bundle to `/Applications`, then atomically clones the
canonical `main` checkout below
`~/Library/Application Support/LOO-UME/`, and delegates installation to the
same bootstrap boundary. `scripts/looume.sh` owns one background server PID,
readiness URL, and log. Reopening the icon opens the existing server; update,
stop, and status use the same ownership record. If an older removal loses that
record, the launcher can recover only a listener whose PID command path and
LOO/UME readiness response both match the managed checkout. It does not adopt
an unrelated service on the same port. A managed in-editor update
restarts through this launcher so the PID does not become stale. Developer
checkouts continue to restart directly through `bootstrap.sh`. Launch, first
install, and application-copy serialization use unique atomic PID claims;
stale cleanup never deletes a reusable shared lock path.
When a downloaded launcher differs from an existing installed bundle, the app
replacement leaves a durable pending-upgrade marker. The stable installed app
then uses `looume --update`, which stops the verified owned server before the
fast-forward update and restarts one current server. The marker is cleared only
after success. An identical translocated or installed bundle skips this path
and reuses the running service.

The legacy Mac launcher ZIP is an independent GitHub release asset. Only an
explicit `mac-launcher-v*` tag or manual workflow run starts its macOS-only job,
which converts the deterministic icon source to `.icns`, validates the bundle,
applies an ad-hoc review signature, and archives resource forks with `ditto`.
Tagged builds use their tag version; manual builds use a unique run-number
version and serialize per ref. A manual run publishes one unique prerelease
with a direct, single-ZIP review download; it does not replace the latest public
release. Apple notarization is not claimed.

The Electron desktop package reuses the compiled browser editor and the Node
service modules in one application process. Its internal HTTP server listens
on a random loopback port. The Electron main process owns Project Library
storage, generated files, logs, Art-Net and DDP receivers, private WLED access,
and shutdown.
After successful ESP32 setup, Electron stores reconnect authorization in its
application data. Wi-Fi credentials use a separate encrypted file through Electron
`safeStorage`. The local credential endpoint rejects external origins and never
writes credentials into projects. Browser development uses local browser storage
instead; clearing that storage removes its saved credentials. USB Wi-Fi scans use
the existing Improv session protocol and release the port before flashing.

Reconnect authorization remains in the Electron
application-data directory. This authorization is independent of the random
loopback port. After a verified connection, Electron also saves the current
project as a separate `.loo.zip` startup copy. A later process restores this
copy before device discovery, unless an explicit sculpture URL selects another
project. The copy preserves poses, routes, GPIOs, and available referenced assets.
Portable profiles remain embedded; catalog profiles keep their original references
and use the packaged catalog. A damaged startup copy stops automatic reconnect
but keeps the default editor usable. This copy does not replace Project Library
saves or preserve later unconnected edits.
A later Electron process can verify and reconnect the same WLED
device without another flash. Browser and LAN modes continue to use
origin-local storage or an approved serial permission.
Closing the last Electron window quits the application and closes its local
service on every platform. A later icon launch starts one new process and one
new window. This explicit lifecycle makes Finder removal unambiguous and does
not leave a hidden Mac process after the operator closes the window.
Browser/LAN and managed-checkout launch modes remain supported review and
development paths.

Electron grants Web Serial only to its own loopback editor origin and only for
the approved Silicon Labs CP2102 USB identity. MadMapper sends Art-Net to
`127.0.0.1:6454`; the existing preview path consumes that frame. The
private-device DDP broker sends the visible simulator frame to WLED.
Developer utilities can replace output GPIO assignments with unique approved
ESP32-WROOM output pins. The change preserves routes and physical addresses.
The device link stops until ESP32 setup applies the changed bus configuration.
The TouchDesigner `.tox` component samples its TOP in logical order. It sends
bounded DDP to the simulator. The operator accepts LIVE-020 as a working
assumption.

Packaged Electron updates reuse the update-notice HTTP contract through
`electron-updater`. A release tag must be contained in canonical `main`, and a
public Mac update must have a stable Developer ID signature and Apple
notarization. Unsigned manual workflow builds are review artifacts, not the
update feed; each manual run publishes one direct prerelease DMG for review.
Project Library data remains outside the replaceable application
bundle. A first desktop launch imports the earlier managed Mac Project Library
only when the Electron library is empty.
Electron is the primary Mac installation. Every application-changing canonical
`main` push packages the universal unsigned application and refreshes one fixed
prerelease DMG URL plus bounded version metadata. Documentation-only and
test-only pushes skip that package. A packaged free build validates that fixed
metadata and offers the approved DMG URL when its numeric version is newer.
Replacement remains manual; the prerelease does not become an automatic-update
feed. A later signed Electron release can own the repository's latest release
and verified updater feed. The older
managed-checkout launcher can still publish archived tagged or manual releases,
but it does not run for ordinary `main` pushes.

For the legacy launcher, a normal Finder launch first copies the small app
wrapper to `/Applications`,
then hands control from that stable path to one visible Terminal session. It
never asks Terminal to reopen an ephemeral App Translocation path. The terminal
shows Git download progress, streams the managed server setup log, and reports
the ready URL. If another checkout owns port 4173, the managed installation
preserves that process and records the next free port for later icon and command
launches. The release also contains
a command-file uninstaller.
It stops the launcher-owned process, copies `projects/local` to a timestamped
folder in Documents, and then removes the managed Application Support tree,
application bundle, and matching command link. It does not delete unrelated
exports.

## Geometry and fabrication boundary

Panel poses remain authoritative. A GLB can constrain placement but is not
printable material and cannot replace a saved pose. Printable generation:

```text
poses + panel outline
        |
exposed-edge gap detection
        |
flat simple N-gon caps
        |
planarity / winding / intersection / manifold validation
        |
pinned manifold-3d 3.5.1
        |
boundary.stl + exact part STLs
```

`GeneratePanelClosureSolids.ts` owns the printable solid construction.
`CompilePanelBoundaryBundle.ts` owns the in-memory boundary and asset contract.
`GeneratePanelBoundaryParts.ts` writes a verified bundle through a temporary
directory and atomic publication. The browser uses the same in-memory compiler.

The first generator supports layouts where each detected gap is a flat simple
N-gon. Ambiguous junctions, invalid caps, intersections, or non-manifold
boundaries fail before asset publication. Printable material must stay outside
PCB envelopes and keep DIN, DOUT, V+, V-, and blocked mounting holes clear.

Fabrication converts measured back-view hardware coordinates into the outward
pose frame before planar or structural hole allocation. The structural route
does not use GLB triangles. It derives eligible mounting holes and DIN/DOUT
clearance volumes from panel poses and the selected profile. Its axial truss
results guide
load paths but are not engineering certification. Printable ribbon and bridge
solids still require exact hardware-clearance, PCB-envelope, Manifold, and
print-envelope checks. See `docs/STRUCTURAL_WORKFLOW.md`.

## Browser and local host

`web/src/main.ts` coordinates editing, rendering, mapping, wiring, generation,
and export. `ProjectLoader.ts` owns the stateless registry and Schema 2 loading
adapter; it returns the existing project and mapping/wiring contract without
owning application state. Other focused modules own portable projects,
assembly-package bytes, renderer state, route editing, mapping, and Manifold
runtime handling.
`AssemblyTutorial.ts` is a stateless view model over `WiringPreview`; it adds no
saved route or tutorial state. `SphereRenderer.ts` applies its temporary panel
visibility mask, reuses the normal back-side connector and cable layers, shows
one or two bright-red incident solder connections for panel focus while muting
the other selected-chain cables, and grays non-active chain panels. Printable
closure ownership comes only from its screw-tab panel IDs; combined assets with
no reliable ownership stay visible without a false attachment claim. The
renderer keeps referenced printable assets visible and does not mutate the
user-controlled camera. Cable curves use a
control point inside the endpoint radius relative to the current sculpture
center. The
controller defaults to a schematic near-top placement derived from the complete
current route. The operator can select its body or label and save an exact 6DOF
pose with the standard transform controls. This pose moves the body, label,
pins, and cable starts; it is not a second saved wiring-route authority.
`PhysicalRouteReview.ts` owns the stateless physical-slot review model. The
hardware path sends its diagnostic through the bounded framebuffer broker. Its
automatic hardware-free fallback maps the same physical diagnostic back to
logical renderer pixels and never calls the device broker or exposes Apply.
The populated 41-panel Schema 2 project is the browser default. The Project
Library is the single project-file surface: it displays every tracked demo and
local ZIP as a newest-first thumbnail browser and contains JSON/ZIP/folder open plus
ZIP/JSON/folder backup and transfer actions. Each card opens its actual ZIP
through the same bounded portable-project loader used for local imports. Empty
authoring projects remain explicit demo choices.
The sidebar has no wizard state or numbered progression. Project and View remain
available, followed by always-editable Shape, Fixtures, Mapping, and Fabrication
toolboxes. Project keeps one quick Save beside the Project Library entry point;
the dialog owns the longer file actions. Animation controls stay in View
because they remain useful throughout the work. Mapping owns route optimization
and its advanced editor. One normal project action downloads the editable
project with all current fabrication, mapping, WLED, MadMapper, and
TouchDesigner files. Separate MadMapper and fabrication ZIP controls are in
Developer utilities. Fabrication keeps part generation, the assembly tutorial,
and ESP32 setup. Each loaded fixture profile controls part-generation actions.
Mapping, simulation, hardware setup, and export remain independent.
The renderer offsets rigid-panel LED sprites 2.4 mm along each panel's outward
normal. Explicit radial-frame flexible-path emitters define their physical
outside surface positions and receive no additional panel-normal offset. Both rules are
display-only and do not change mapping or saved poses. The transparent WebGL
canvas uses the viewer's radial and linear CSS gradient as its world backdrop.
Rigid and planar PCB surfaces use the profile's back-view mounting coordinates,
mirror X into the outward pose frame, and triangulate around each real preview-
diameter hole. These are true surface openings rather than decorative dots.
The viewport does not rotate automatically. Manual orbit is view state only;
selection and camera movement never change a saved pose.
Panel ID labels use the DIN marker from the current wiring preview instead
of the panel center. This renderer placement and the printable label PDF do not
change the panel pose or the route.
Surface mode keeps the established constrained move and local-Z rotation.
Free 6DOF mode uses local translation and rotation controls, writes one
right-handed pose, and removes the old surface attachment. Structural downloads
ZIP the same hash-verified connector asset set shown in the viewport.

Manifold normally runs in a browser module worker. `GenerationClient.ts` owns
one worker per request and transfers generated asset buffers back to the editor.
`GenerationWorker.ts` calls the same planar and structural compilers as Node.
The worker returns only data needed for asset display and export. It keeps
compiler mesh details outside the browser control module. Worker failures retain
their runtime or geometry classification. The client rejects concurrent requests
and terminates its worker after completion or disposal. A project revision check
rejects obsolete worker results before the editor applies generated assets.
Planar generation can use the local HTTP fallback if the worker cannot start
or load its runtime. Geometry and request-cloning errors do not use that fallback.
Other asynchronous project-loading operations still need the REVIEW-022 work.

The local server and Vite adapter share
`createEditorPipelineHandler()`, which is a bounded loopback/same-origin fallback
for a Manifold runtime-load failure. Geometry and validation errors do not use
the fallback. The JSON field is limited to 5 MB and the complete multipart
request to 64 MB.

The server verifies referenced GLB bytes and safe relative paths before staging.
It writes all STL files, verifies hashes and mesh structure, writes JSON last,
and publishes the completed directory atomically.

## Simulator-to-hardware boundary

The first multi-device slice adds a read-only discovery plane. The Node service
browses `_wled._tcp.local`, resolves bounded PTR/SRV/A records, and verifies
private on-subnet candidates through bounded `/json/info` requests. Each scan
uses fresh sockets and records, so DHCP changes do not inherit a stale service
cache. DNS names and TXT records are hints; validated WLED JSON supplies the MAC.
Repeated MACs at different addresses are conflicts, not selectable pairings.
Manual IP lookup uses the same identity checks when multicast is unavailable.

`SculptureDevices.ts` shows online and paired offline devices. The local registry
stores project ID/name, mapping fingerprint, and the address used at pairing.
Pairing rechecks MAC before an atomic local save. Electron stores this registry
in user data; Vite and checkout servers use ignored `.tools/sculpture-devices.json`.
This registry stores no credentials and does not authorize output or contain
the saved project itself. It is separate from the legacy fixed-name reconnect
and startup ZIP. Automatic session migration and simultaneous playback remain
planned; discovery never calls that reconnect path or writes WLED settings.
See [network review](SCULPTURE_NETWORK_REVIEW.md) and
[multi-sculpture plan](MULTI_SCULPTURE_PLAN.md).

The browser proves a logical-to-physical permutation in memory. The
receipt-bound browser flash, Improv setup, one-panel smoke test, and three-panel
DDP/preset/reconnect/power-cycle path have physical evidence. They do not prove
the complete 41-panel sculpture. The 41-panel project stores an authored assumed
route with chain lengths `11/10/10/10`, GPIOs 16–19, measured GRB
order, measured straight row-major pixel order, and route-optimized installed
quarter turns.

New automatic routes rotate the authoritative panel pose around local Z so the
viewport and assembly tutorial show physical DIN/DOUT locations. The resulting
installed-address transform is route-optimized identity; it is not a second
mechanical orientation authority. Legacy address-only turns remain loadable and
are folded into the pose by explicit optimization. Bus reversal is false.

The optimizer uses one to four balanced outputs with at most 11 panels each and
assigns GPIOs 16–19 in output order. If no generated-part manifest exists, it
may evaluate all four quarter turns. Once `generatedMechanics` or
`generatedStructure` exists, including a stale manifest, the durable gate allows
only the current pose or a 180-degree turn. This prevents a stale fingerprint
from reopening 90-degree choices after fabrication.
An optional `wiring.panelRotationConstraint: "half-turns-only"` supplies the
same durable limit when physical parts predate generated-manifest tracking. The
Developer utilities button is the explicit operator authority for that case;
the optional field keeps older Schema 2 projects compatible.
For this manual-gate/no-manifest case only, optimization treats current saved
poses as fabricated authority and replaces assumed legacy address-only turns
with identity before its 0/180-degree search. Manifest-backed projects retain
strict conflict rejection.

Mapping readiness is separate from electrical approval. A production bundle
must bind the current project, route, ledmap, WLED bus fragment, target identity,
and exact file hashes. The optional legacy hardware-verified state still
accepts a `PROOF-010` receipt. No complete 2,624-address proof is planned.

`PhysicalRouteReview.ts` is a temporary address-audit model over the current
mapping-ready contract. It flattens each output into unique physical fixture
blocks and holds proposed panel IDs and back-view address turns outside the
authored project. `main.ts` pauses ordinary frames, reconnects no other work,
locks the control panel, and leaves only panel selection active in the 3D
viewport. The review frame uses the fixed private-device DDP broker and lights
one block; it does not write WLED state or project data.

Cancel discards the model. Apply creates one new manual authored route revision
and measured installed-address transforms, then recompiles the normal hardware
contract. It does not mutate panel poses, generated mechanics, structural
artifacts, controller geometry, GPIO assignments, or the panel profile. The
existing ledmap synchronization seam must upload, activate, and read back the
exact changed map before the editor enables live preview again.
An ambiguous device failure retains the reviewed target and keeps ordinary
editing and live output locked. A bounded retry reconciles the same bytes; it
does not discard the transaction or resume the old mapping after a possible
device mutation.

The local editor serves the receipt-bound flash image and brokers the later
WLED HTTP configuration/read-back calls. The browser supplies only the private
IPv4 address returned by the verified Improv session and a fixed WLED operation.
The loopback handler rejects public targets, arbitrary paths, redirects, and
oversized request or response bodies. This same-origin boundary avoids browser
cross-origin/private-network restrictions without making a general LAN proxy.

Firmware build `2609051` requests 128 RMT symbols for each LED output.
Four outputs fit the classic ESP32's 512-symbol memory.
The receipt records the exact NeoPixelBus patch and compiled image hashes.
The operator confirmed output on GPIOs 16, 17, 21, and 22.
This test does not establish complete sculpture address parity or extended stability.

For a loaded sculpture of one to 41 complete 8x8 panels on up to four outputs,
the editor derives LED count, GPIOs, ledmap, current values, and animation directly
from the current simulator. There is no separate configuration choice. It saves
the selected native WLED
effect, palette, speed, intensity, colors, and brightness as preset 1 and makes
it the boot preset. The setup config writes the boot-preset selection once.
Later preset writes omit both WLED's immediate API-call flag and the boot-preset
field, so they use only its asynchronous state-save path; exact eventual read-
back still requires boot preset 1. The editor pauses DDP, drains an in-flight
frame, and sends `live:false` before the snapshot so WLED cannot save a frozen
realtime segment instead of the selected native effect.
It restarts WLED and verifies the config, preset, state,
device identity, and boot-preset selection before setup succeeds. Because HTTP
can recover after discovery, this complete snapshot has a bounded retry. Later
control changes update the same standalone preset.
The browser suspends DDP for the complete setup operation. This prevents a live
frame from freezing WLED realtime state before the native preset is verified.
It also drains prior reconnect, preset-save, and frame requests before flashing.

FIRM-014 implements the exact loaded framebuffer as a separate DDP preview. The
loopback host accepts only 1 to 2,624 RGB pixels, splits frames into WLED's
1,440-channel DDP packets, and sends them only to a private IPv4 address on
fixed DDP port 4048. WLED is
configured with a 2.5-second realtime timeout so it can resume the saved native
animation if the browser, host, network, or laptop stops sending frames. The
editor keeps one request in flight, updates at no more than 10 frames per
second, and backs off after a network error. The sender applies the pinned WLED
2.2 color-gamma curve because realtime input is configured with `no-gc: true`;
native and DDP pixels therefore use the same output color pipeline. This is a
bounded test-sculpture link for the loaded sculpture.
After a page reload, the link reconnects only if the fixed mDNS name, private
IP, MAC, ESP32 identity, LED count, and complete persisted loaded bus set still
match. Automatic discovery starts only after this browser origin completed a
successful setup/link or still has permission for the approved CP2102. A
hardware-free browser does not probe `loo-ume.local`. A panel pose edit
intentionally changes the spatial ledmap but not the
physical route or bus layout. After identity and bus verification, reconnect
uploads that valid changed map, activates map 0 through the WLED state API,
verifies the active map and exact stored bytes, and only then updates the
standalone preset and resumes DDP. Invalid map JSON and all other contract
mismatches still stop without a controller mutation.
The operator physically confirmed on the 192-LED three-panel project that WLED
leaves DDP realtime mode and runs the saved native animation. A USB power cycle
also restored the same animation without the simulator.

The simulator accepts external frames through two bounded input paths. The
desktop service automatically shares UDP `127.0.0.1:6454` with MadMapper after
the physical mapping becomes ready. It accepts only bounded ArtDMX packets from
loopback, and assembles the exact consecutive physical universes exported in
the MadMapper fixture atlas. The downloaded MadMapper package includes one
importable unicast routing-table row for each of those universes. The service
publishes only complete RGB frames through a same-origin binary HTTP stream.
The Art-Net client reopens the stream after three seconds without a complete
frame. Each retry waits 500 ms for the previous UDP listener to close.
This restores reception when MadMapper binds the shared port after LOO/UME.
An explicit stop cancels the active request and all retries.
The browser maps those physical indices back to the current logical renderer
indices and shows them on the pose-derived 3D LEDs. The DDP service listens on
UDP port 4048 for local and LAN senders. It accepts only complete bounded RGB
frames in logical order. The newest complete Art-Net or DDP frame controls the
simulator. When WLED connects, the browser forwards that visible logical frame
through bounded WLAN DDP. Project and mapping changes restart both inputs.
A one-second signal timeout shows and forwards the native simulation again.

`src/wled/DiagnosticFrames.ts` derives deterministic low-brightness, one-pixel
frames from the same deployment identity and mapping contract. Its bounded HTTP
adapter transports exact WLED JSON requests; it does not create observation
evidence or a second mapping authority.

Electrical design and protection are external operator responsibilities. WLED
current values are copied operating assumptions, not electrical approval.

## Verification boundaries

- Vitest covers Schema 2 parsing, editing, placement, mapping, wiring, boundary
  validation, structural analysis/connectors, Manifold solids, exact asset
  handling, local hosting, and WASM.
- Playwright covers real authoring, project portability, route editing,
  in-browser part generation, package contents, and ZIP reopen.
- Each push and pull request runs one fast gate: locked dependency install,
  checked-in WLED WASM verification, TypeScript, and the Vite production build.
- A nightly GitHub Actions schedule runs the full suite at 02:17 UTC. The
  **Run workflow** action can also start it on demand. It adds Vitest, Chromium
  journeys, real Manifold STL output, stage-zero binary checks, and
  restricted-PATH clean setup on Linux x86-64 and native macOS arm64 and
  x86-64 runners.

These checks do not prove physical fit, electrical safety, firmware behavior,
network transport, or full native WLED effect parity.
