# Project task board

Last reconciled: 2026-08-22
Integration baseline: `main`, including the unified UI, Manifold-only
fabrication, checked WLED simulator runtime, and Schema 2-only mapping path.

Current milestone: produce one guarded simulator-to-ESP32 deployment contract,
then prove static address and RGB parity on the physical 41-panel sculpture.

## Control rules

1. Use stable task IDs in commits and handoffs.
2. Lifecycle: **Backlog -> Ready -> In Progress -> Blocked or Human Review ->
   Ready to Merge -> Done**.
3. Keep at most one implementation slice In Progress. Bounded audits may run in
   parallel when their files do not overlap.
4. Record scope, acceptance, dependencies, verification, owner branch/worktree,
   and likely conflicts only when useful.
5. Use FAST by default, STANDARD for substantial normal features, and QUALITY
   for architecture, geometry, conflict, ambiguity, or high risk. Escalate
   Luna -> Terra -> Sol only when evidence requires it.
6. FAST needs orchestrator diff inspection and focused checks. Use an
   independent review when justified in STANDARD and for QUALITY/high-risk work.
7. Completed task-branch work stops at Ready to Merge. Integrate into `main`
   only with explicit operator authorization. After verified integration and
   push, move the task to Done and clean up only task-owned resources.
8. Never force-push, discard unfamiliar changes, or delete another owner's
   branch or worktree.
9. Stop when acceptance criteria and relevant checks pass. Record later ideas
   as separate tasks.

## Backlog

### `MECH-020` Add correction tools for a proven ambiguous gap case

- Acceptance: accept, reject, reorder, or redraw a candidate cycle; persist the
  confirmed topology; preserve panel poses and geometry authority.
- Depends on: a concrete unsupported project.

### `FAB-020` Add one evidence-backed fabrication enhancement

- Acceptance: one real model defines the need; Manifold output preserves PCB
  envelopes and connector access; mesh and physical review pass.

### `ARCH-010` Split browser orchestration along covered behavior boundaries

- Acceptance: project, placement, mechanics, mapping, wiring, package, and
  rendering journeys remain covered; no new manager or state authority.

### `SEC-010` Bound ZIP resource use

- Acceptance: reject excessive entry count, individual size, total expansion,
  and suspicious ratios before buffering; normal packages round-trip.

### `PLACE-010` Preflight automatic-placement footprints

- Acceptance: return non-overlapping poses or identify panels that cannot fit.

### `CAD-020` Apply one fit preflight to every authored generation entry

- Acceptance: browser and CLI reject the same invalid PCB envelope or boundary
  before asset publication.

### `MAP-020` Version and strengthen ledmap fingerprints

- Acceptance: indices that differ above bit 15 produce different identities;
  compatibility behavior is tested and documented.

### `DIAG-010` Deliver deterministic hardware diagnostic frames

- Acceptance: frames identify output, panel, local coordinate, logical and
  physical index, and RGB channel; retry and request-size behavior is tested.
- Depends on: `FIRM-011`.

### `PROOF-010` Prove simulator-to-device address and RGB parity

- Acceptance: all 2,624 addresses, row transitions, corners, outputs, and RGB
  channels agree with the exact deployment manifest and recorded bench result.
- Depends on: `DIAG-010`, `HW-012`, and `WIRE-012`.

## Ready

### `VALID-010` Make LED dimensions profile-driven end to end — P1

- Acceptance: one non-8x8 profile parses, maps, validates, exports, and reloads.

### `VALID-011` Centralize deep Schema 2 runtime validation — P2

- Acceptance: browser and CLI share one loader for nested mapping, calibration,
  boundary, generated asset, and note validation.

### `INSTALL-011` Complete one-command clean-checkout bootstrap — P2

- Scope: repository-local Node/npm, npm dependencies, Manifold generator proof,
  and desktop start without administrator or global PATH changes.
- Depends on: `BUILD-010` removing the WLED source/compiler requirement from
  normal `main` setup.

## In Progress

No tasks.

## Blocked

### `INSTALL-012` Prove automatic setup on clean Linux and macOS systems

- Blocked by: `INSTALL-011`.

### `PWR-010` Approve power and protection

- Blocked by: available hardware, electrical calculation, and physical review.
- Acceptance: supply, domains, injection, wire, connector, fuse, voltage-drop,
  derating, inrush, backfeed, and current-limit plan passes before full power.

### `HW-012` Record the installed 41-panel route

- Blocked by: `PWR-010`, `FIRM-011`, and physical assembly.

### `FIRM-010` Add later transport or audio behavior

- Blocked by: `PROOF-010` plus explicit board, network, microphone, and
  transport decisions.

## Human Review

### `FIRM-011` Flash and smoke-test the minimum pinned WLED target — P1

- Software ready: off-main build branch `generate/wled-firmware` at `8089c79`
  reproducibly emits the 1,107,920-byte binary with SHA-256
  `0468ee34c8b9578504c3f4a708421eaa7b70663b691d5df430f46ea009fdabd7`.
  The guarded installation identity is
  `899f7775e278bd17bf10584c652a32e729076410f9a72414591dfb7e8ccce579`.
- Main contract owner: `codex/firm-011-esp32-deployment` in
  `/tmp/led-rhombo-firm-011`. The binary remains off-main.
- Acceptance remaining: flash one real ESP32-DevKitC V4; smoke-test one fused
  64-pixel panel through the level shifter with the 1,000 mA configuration;
  record the board, panel, fuse, supply limit, colors, and result; install the
  exact full ledmap and bus configuration only with LED power disconnected.
- Do not energize the complete sculpture. `PWR-010` remains separate.

### `HR-006` Physically review representative Manifold parts

## Ready to Merge

No tasks.

## Done

- `LEGACY-011`: retired the Schema 1 schema, migration fixture/script,
  procedural mapping path, and legacy-only tests; the 41-panel Schema 2 project
  and deployment artifacts remain byte-identical.
- `BUILD-010`: normal development and CI now verify the checked-in WLED
  simulator without Python, Emscripten, or a WLED checkout. Reproducible source
  generation remains on `generate/wled-simulator` at `64b743a`.
- `WIRE-012`: integrated the shared guarded browser/CLI deployment policy in
  `main` at `d900cdb`; mapping-ready input gets exact WLED installation files,
  while draft or stale input gets only explicit diagnostic artifacts.
- `CTRL-008`: recorded the operator-approved visual, panel-profile, WLED
  generation, Schema 2, stale-mechanics, and boundary-format decisions in
  `main` at `ee8f79f`; physical Manifold print review remains open as `HR-006`.
- `UI-011`: operator approved the opaque glossy black PCB appearance.
- `CAL-010`: operator approved the existing panel profile for the current
  41-panel build. Existing measured values stay measured; provisional or
  unknown electrical, pad, and address facts are not relabelled as measurements
  and remain subject to `PWR-010` and `PROOF-010`.
- `HR-013`: normal `main` will use the checked-in WLED simulator and will not
  require Python or Emscripten; reproducible generation moves to a dedicated
  branch under `BUILD-010`.
- `HR-005`: confirmed the 41-panel authority is Schema 2; `LEGACY-011` retired
  the remaining Schema 1 migration dependencies.
- `HR-008`: stale generated parts stay hidden until regeneration; no stale-part
  inspection toggle is required.
- `HR-009`: keep JSON poses/topology and STL output; do not add another boundary
  asset format without a concrete future need.
- `UI-019`: removed the performance overlay and individual-file export menu,
  moved secondary display and GLB controls into Advanced Tools, and unified
  operator messages in one activity log in `main` at `6615c54`.
- `CTRL-007`: removed the retired printable toolchain and its generated
  artifacts, made Manifold the only printable-parts kernel, and established
  FAST/STANDARD/QUALITY execution and Luna/Terra/Sol routing in `main` at
  `33d6455`.
- `UI-012`–`UI-018`: integrated browser-first Manifold status, generation,
  package/manual downloads, bounded JSON fallback, simplified controls, and
  unified project/route/package workflow in `main` at `e278333`.
- `CAD-030`–`CAD-037`: pinned Manifold solids, browser/local compilation,
  exact assets, pose-only caps, labels, planar tolerances, and CI proof.
- `WIRE-010`–`WIRE-015`, `MAP-021`, `MAP-022`, `MAP-030`, `HW-016`, `HW-017`:
  authored routes, lifecycle, route editor, assembly manual, installed address
  transforms, GPIO/bus contract, and corrected mapping assumptions.
- `CORE-001`, `ASSET-001`, `BOUNDARY-001`, `PARTS-001`, `PORTABLE-001`,
  `TEST-010`, `TEST-011`: pose-first editor, portable assets, validated
  boundary, exact parts, folder/ZIP support, and real browser journeys.
- `CTRL-001`–`CTRL-005`: persistent task board, safe workflow, failure learning,
  architecture reconstruction, and simulator-to-hardware priority.
